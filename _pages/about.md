I am a data scientist, researcher, developer and entrepreneur. I founded [objectiv.org](https://objectiv.org/), a Seville-based independent nonprofit focused on automated fact checking, stance and hidden bias detection within news media content across new and social media. I am also Chief Scientist at [R2P.AI](https://r2p.ai/), a UK based AI consultancy, and Head of AI at [Send Technology](https://send.technology/), an insurtech company based in London. 

Previously, I was a specialist AI mentor at [Impact Accelerator](https://www.impact-accelerator.com/) for European startups; Lead NLP / Machine Learning Engineer at [Piksel](https://piksel.com/), a broadcast and media technology group; co-founder and Lead Data Scientist at music startup [Humm](https://www.linkedin.com/company/humm-ltd/); Data Scientist at [Skimlinks](https://skimlinks.com/); Research Scientist at [Universidad de Sevilla](https://www.us.es/); Quant at [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) and at [Citigroup](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/).

Talks I've given include [the future of AI in the music industry](https://www.monkeyweek.org/en/speakers/michael-gordon-uk/), at [Monkey Week's PRO conference](https://www.monkeyweek.org/en/monkey-week-pro-2020/) funded through [INES](https://www.ines-festivals.eu/); and on [the ethical, legal, social and economic impact of AI within the commercial insurance industry](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/communities/en/community/humaint/event/humaint-winter-school-ai-ethical-social-legal-and-economic-impact), as part of the [HUMAINT](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/communities/en/community/humaint) project organised by the [JRC's Centre for Advanced Studies](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research/centre-advanced-studies) of the European Commission. 

My main research interests include natural language understanding, low-resource learning, automated fact checking, stance and hidden bias detection, with a focus on news media content across new and social media.
